HTTP requests using Axios:-
-------------------------------
Axios is a very popular JavaScript library you can use to perform HTTP requests,
that works in both Browser and Node.js platforms.

Installation:-
--------------
Axios can be installed to be used in Node.js using npm:

    ex:-  npm install axios --save

In the browser, you can include it in your page using unpkg.com:

 ex-    <script src="https://unpkg.com/axios/dist/axios.min.js"></script>
 
Remembering that API calls must enable CORS to be accessed inside the browser, otherwise the request will fail.

Ajax:-
------
Ajax is a standard and web development technique (Ajax (programming) - Wikipedia). 
Axios is just a JavaScript library that helps you to use Ajax easier. 
There are other JavaScript libraries, such as jQuery (jQuery), Request (request/request), Fetch (github/fetch), 
that help to do similar functionalities.


Interceptors:-
--------------------
Catching is implemented with the Axios feature called interceptors. It's possible to catch all requests 
before they are sent and modify them. Also, responses and errors can be caught globally. 
For example, interceptors are useful when you want to modify request headers before a request is sent or 
you are implementing some kind of global error handling system.

Of course, for real use case, it might be too general to handle all requests and responses in the same way. 
Thatâ€™s why we will also have a configuration option for each HTTP requests to disable global handling.
