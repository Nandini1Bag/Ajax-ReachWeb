Note: This package provides the core routing functionality for React Router, but you might not want to 
install it directly. If you are writing an application that will run in the browser, you should instead 
install react-router-dom. Similarly, if you are writing a React Native application, you should instead install 
react-router-native. Both of those will install react-router as a dependency.

=>DOM bindings for React Router.

$ npm install --save react-router-dom
